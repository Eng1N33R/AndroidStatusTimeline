# StatusTimeline

A simple Android library for displaying a timeline similar to the widget
on [Discord's status page](status.discordapp.com).



## Usage

To use this library, include it in your Android module's `build.gradle`
script:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.engi.android:status-timeline:1.0.0'
}
```

Alternatively, include it in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
       <groupId>io.engi.android</groupId>
       <artifactId>status-timeline</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Documentation

The library provides adequate javadocs that explain its methods and
classes. You may also take a look at the wiki, or consult the example
app in the repository for a working example.
